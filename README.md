HTML5 🏗: Builds the foundation of the web page.
CSS3 🎨: Powers the stunning animations, blur effects, and responsive design.
JavaScript ⚡: Handles modal interactions and keyboard events with ease.
Canvas (Optional) 🖼: Add dynamic background animations for extra flair!

🎨 Optional Canvas Integration
Want to level up with a canvas-based background (e.g., particles or waves)? Here’s how:

Add a <canvas> element to index.html inside the <section> tag.
Update script.js with canvas logic. Example:const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
document.querySelector('.secClass').appendChild(canvas);
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
// Add your dazzling canvas animation here! ✨
